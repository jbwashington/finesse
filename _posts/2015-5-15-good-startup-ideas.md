1.  Low-cost community-controlled security for countries with high crime and corruption, based on mesh network of solar powered raspberry pis that feed to public site, with no central point of failure, with anonymous reporting.

2.  Programming tutorials for urban youth with Zaytoven beats playing in the background, and programming paradigms explained through the use of trap rhetoric and Migos references.

3.  Autonomous DIY gardens that cultivate and harvest vegetables, crickets, and chicken eggs autonomously.

4.  Bitcoin prepaid cards that function similar to Greendot cards, but with no fees, other than tipping the blockchain.

5.  Github for government, where policies are forked and merged by citizens.

title: 3 Foods to Look Out For in 2016
---
There have been some pretty solid food additions to my diet in 2016, but there are 3 that stand out particularly:

  - Heavy Whipping Cream
  - Butter
  - Garlic

Heavy whipping cream took the place of half-and-half for morning  coffee, and it definitely kicks it up a notch.  I get all kinda work done.

Butter has been going in everything lately, from scrambled eggs to bread, even waffles.  I've been putting the butter in the microwave for a few seconds, just to help it spread easier.  I really hate it when the butter is hard and unable to be spread, it just destroys the waffle, especially if it's a weak waffle to begin with.  Speaking of which, I've been putting the waffles in the toaster oven lately, and the difference is remarkable.  I find that the toaster burns the outside too much, but fails to cook the inside sufficiently, no matter what I set the dial to.

Garlic is going to be making waves in 2016, and it's not just gonna be some fad ingredient.  I've been rocking with the garlic for a minute now, but I tried putting some in the rice cooker with a bay leaf and some white rice, and it's sensational.  I plan to use the whole garlic cloves more in 2016, instead of that minced garlic in the jar.
